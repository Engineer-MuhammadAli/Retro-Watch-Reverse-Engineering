# Retro-Watch-Reverse-Engineering
Reverse engineering a 90s wristwatch for affordable CNC manufacturing. 3D modeled in SolidWorks, toolpaths generated in Fusion 360.
# 90s Watch Reverse Engineering Project üï∞Ô∏è

This open-source project reverse engineers a vintage 1990s wristwatch. The aim is to recreate it using affordable materials and CNC machining to reduce manufacturing costs and make it accessible.

## Goals
- Digitally preserve a classic 90s watch
- Modify and improve design using CAD
- CNC-machine it using Fusion 360 G-codes
- Share everything open-source to encourage contributors

## Software Used
- SolidWorks (for 3D modeling)
- Fusion 360 (for toolpath and G-code generation)

## Why Reverse Engineer?
- Enables full design control
- Allows quick changes to dimensions or aesthetics
- Helps reduce cost using alternate materials


## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Suggest improvements or redesigns
3. Submit G-code variations for different machines
4. Share ideas for low-cost material alternatives
